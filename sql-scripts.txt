--Retrieve all patients with diabetes:

SELECT Name, Age, Gender, Region
FROM Patients;

--List all diagnoses for a specific patient:
SELECT * FROM Diagnoses
WHERE PatientID = 1;

--Get all treatments and their duration for a specific patient:
SELECT TreatmentType, StartDate, EndDate
FROM Treatments
WHERE PatientID = 1;

--Find lifestyle factors of patients with Type 2 Diabetes:
SELECT p.Name, l.PhysicalActivityLevel, l.DietaryHabits
FROM Patients p
JOIN Diagnoses d ON p.PatientID = d.PatientID
JOIN LifestyleFactors l ON p.PatientID = l.PatientID
WHERE d.DiagnosisType = 'Type 2 Diabetes';

--Data Analysis Queries
Average age of patients with Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes:
SELECT DiagnosisType, AVG(p.Age) AS AvgAge
FROM Patients p
JOIN Diagnoses d ON p.PatientID = d.PatientID
GROUP BY DiagnosisType;

--Count of patients by region:
SELECT Region, COUNT(*) AS PatientCount
FROM Patients
GROUP BY Region;

--Number of treatments initiated in the last year:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TreatmentCount
FROM Treatments
WHERE StartDate >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
